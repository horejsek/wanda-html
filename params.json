That's all.\r\n\r\nAnd one more thing. If you use 'easter egg' variant, you can pass second parametr (`new Wanda(true, true);`) by which you tell whether to show the fish after reload or not. You know, you have to kill real easter egg and this is similar except you have to close browser window.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
